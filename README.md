#  Data Science & Machine Learning Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio â€” a collection of academic and personal projects developed during my MSc in Data Science at Jheronimus Academy of Data Science (JADS).  
Each project demonstrates my ability to design **end-to-end data and machine learning pipelines**, from data preprocessing and feature engineering to model development, evaluation, and visualization.

This portfolio highlights my work in **machine learning, deep learning, and data analytics**, showcasing hands-on experience with **Python, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn, and Azure Databricks**.  
I focus on building efficient, reproducible, and scalable solutions with clear analytical impact.

##  Featured Projects

1. **Bird Detection from Drone Images (YOLOv8, RF-DETR)**  
   Object detection pipeline for small bird identification in aerial imagery using YOLOv8 and transformer-based RF-DETR.  
   Includes hyperparameter optimization (Optuna), data augmentation, and real-time inference optimization.

2. **Abalone Age Prediction (MLP Regression)**  
   Regression model predicting abalone age using deep learning (PyTorch).  
   Implemented hierarchical regularization (Dropout, BatchNorm, L2) and early stopping for stable training and reproducible results.

3. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**  
   Supervised classification project using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and SVM to detect fraudulent transactions.  
   Focused on model interpretability, class imbalance handling, and AUC optimization.

4. **Health Analysis using CDC-NHANES Dataset**  
   Built an end-to-end data mining pipeline to analyze public health outcomes.  
   Applied clustering and association rule mining to explore relationships between health indicators.

5. **Predicting California Housing Prices**  
   Regression pipeline predicting housing prices using Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost.  
   Included feature selection, outlier treatment, and performance comparison across models.
